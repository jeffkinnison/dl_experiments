# dl_experiments
Simple Deep Learning Experiments

## Installation instructions

1.  Install Keras (https://keras.io/#installation).  This requires installing either Theano or Tensorflow (explained in Keras documentation).

2.  Check the code out from github:
```
git clone https://github.com/klannon/dl_experiments.git
```

## Using on CRC

Keras is installed on the CRC.  To access it, do the following on a CRC machine:
```
module load python
```

When you run Python, you'll find Keras (currently only with Theano backend) is installed.  Then you just have to clone the git repo to get going.
